# ARK-Paraserver-Personal-Server-Manager
***NOTE: Script is likely abandoned as file structure for managing server is inadequate and repetitive. A future implementation will be very different***

An incomplete PowerShell script I made to manage my game/voice servers.

This was my first attempt at creating a script to truly manage one of my personal PCs.
I felt I should save my unfinished effort despite not really needing the script anymore. 
I'll likely come back to it or redo it in the near future to some degree.
